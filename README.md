School teachers can typically check attendance in class by looking for empty seats. However, COVID-19 has caused classes to shift online. This has made it more time consuming to check attendance, since teachers would need to cross reference the list of video chat attendees with their class roster multiple times a day.

This tool is designed to import a folder of text files (exported from video chat software), and cross reference them against the teacher's class roster to quickly see who is absent.
