# Remote Classroom Attendance Checker
School teachers can typically check attendance by looking for empty seats in their classroom. However, COVID-19 has caused classes to shift online. This has made it more time consuming for teachers to check attendance, since they need to cross reference the list of video chat attendees with their class roster multiple times a day.

This tool is designed to import a folder of text files (exported from video chat software), and cross reference them against the teacher's class roster to quickly see who is absent.

## Instructions

1. If Excel warns that macros are disabled, click "Enable Content"
2. Ensure the names of the students are in column A exactly as they would appear in the attendance text files.
3. If you want the attendance text files to be deleted after importing, check the box below to the left.
4. Click the "Select Folderâ€¦" button below to the right.
5. Select the folder on your computer that contains the text files of names.
6. In the "Class Roster" worksheet, column G will automatically update to show which names were found in the text files.
7. Check the results to verify whether all text files were imported as expected.
