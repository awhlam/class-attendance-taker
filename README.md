# Remote Classroom Attendance Checker
School teachers can typically check attendance by looking for empty seats in their classroom. However, COVID-19 has caused classes to shift online. This has made it more time consuming for teachers to check attendance, since they need to cross reference the list of video chat attendees with their class roster multiple times a day.

This tool is designed to import a folder of text files (exported from video chat software), and cross reference them against the teacher's class roster to quickly see who is absent.
